      <h2>Yet a week feels frustratingly limited</h2>
      <p>
        The pressure to be more productive and fit ever-increasing quantities of
        activity into a stubbornly non-increasing quantity of time leads to
        productivity anxiety, shriveled attention spans, and burn-out.

      <h2>And there are alarmingly few of&nbsp;them</h2>
      <p>
        You would feel less anxious about wasting an evening doom-scrolling if
        you had an infinite amount of them. Somehow either doing too much or too
        little can create the sense of wasting time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite all this activity we sense there are important and fulfilling
        ways we could be spending our time, even if we can’t say exactly what
        they are. Yet, we systematically spend our time doing other things to
        get by instead.

          I (like many others) felt a wrongness in the world. Life, I knew, was

          holidays. We were not supposed to have to raise our hands to be
          allowed to pee.

      <h2>Productivity is a trap</h2>
      <p>
        There are numerous techniques, products, and services to squeeze the
        most productivity from your week. The problem isn’t that these don’t
        work, it’s that they <em>do work</em>. And yet paradoxically you only
        feel busier, more anxious, and somehow emptier as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day will never arrive when you finally have everything under
        control—when the flood of emails has been contained; when your to-do
        lists have stopped getting longer; when you’re meeting all your
        obligations at work and in your home life; when nobody’s angry with you
        for missing a deadline or dropping the ball; and when the fully
        optimized person you’ve become can turn, at long last, to the things
        life is really supposed to be about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s start by admitting defeat: none of this is ever going to happen.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <blockquote>
          Time feels like an unstoppable conveyer belt, bringing us new tasks as
          fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming “more productive”
          just seems to cause the belt to speed up.

      <h2>Adopt a limit-embracing attitude</h2>
      <p>
        If you truly don’t have time for everything you want to do, or feel you
        ought to do, or that others are badgering you to do, then, well, you
        don’t have time—no matter how grave the consequences of failing to do it
        all might prove to be. So, technically, it’s irrational to feel troubled
        by an overwhelming to-do list. You’ll do what you can, you won’t do what
        you can’t, and the tyrannical inner voice insisting that you must do
        everything is simply mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
        We rarely stop to consider things so rationally, though, because that
        would mean confronting the painful truth of our limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surrender to the reality that things just take the time they take, and
        that you can’t quiet your anxieties by working faster, because it isn’t
        within your power to force reality’s pace as much as you feel you need
        to, and because the faster you go, the faster you’ll feel you need to
        go.

          time there is.

      <h2>How you spend your time is a choice</h2>
      <p>
        We are forced to accept that there will always be too much to do; that
        you can’t make the world run at your preferred speed and so there are
        tough choices to be made: which balls to let drop, which people to
        disappoint, which cherished ambitions to abandon, which roles to fail
        at.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you truly understand that you’re guaranteed to miss out on almost
        every experience the world has to offer, the fact that there are so many
        you still haven’t experienced stops feeling like a problem. Instead, you
        get to focus on fully enjoying the tiny slice of experiences you
        actually do have time for. Digging in to a challenging project that
        can’t be hurried becomes not a trigger for stressful emotions but a
        bracing act of <em>choice</em>.

      <h2>The importance of&nbsp;rest</h2>
      <p>
        A real risk of doing too much is finding your work time, in attempt to
        be productive, encroaching on an evening’s rest. Rest as it turns
        out—whether in the evening, over a weekend, or a vacation—is critical
        for productive creative work. Its absence can lead to stress, burnout,
        and counterintuitively overall poor performance despite the extra hours
        worked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though why should vacations or lazy mornings need defending in terms of
        improved work performance? Enjoying leisure for its own sake—which is
        the whole point of leisure—should not feel as though you’re failing at
        life. Leisure is not merely an opportunity for recovery and
        replenishment for the purposes of further work, but for its intrinsic
        satisfactions.

      <h2>The loneliness of temporal sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        Other human beings are always impinging on your time in countless
        frustrating ways. In an ideal world the only person making decisions
        about your time is you. This comes at a cost that’s not worth paying.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s good to have plenty of time, but having all the time in the world
        isn’t much use if you forced to experience it all on your own. To do
        countless important things with time: to socialize, go on dates, raise
        children, launch businesses, start movements; it has to be synchronized
        with other people. In fact, having large amounts of time but no
        opportunity to use it collaboratively can be actively unpleasant.
      </p>
      <p>
        We treat our time as something to horde, when it’s better approached as
        something to share. Even if that means surrendering some of your power
        to decide exactly what you do with it and when.

          However, the two things must be mingled and varied, solitude and

          cure our distaste for a crowd, and a crowd will cure our boredom with
          solitude.

        Ten tools for embracing finitude
      </h2>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="secnum">1.</div>
      <h2>Adopt a fixed volume approach to productivity</h2>
      <p>
        Tough choices are inevitable; focus on making them consciously and well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep two to-do lists: an “open” one for everything on your plate,
        doubtlessly nightmarishly long, and “closed” with a fixed number of
        entries, only moving tasks onto it when previous ones have been
        completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll never get through all the tasks on the open list, but you were
        never going to in any case. The choice to leave them there is hard, but
        time spent on them is time not spent on the things you chose to focus
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Establish pre-determined time boundaries on your work, and make
        decisions in light of those limits. If your primary goal is to do what’s
        required to be finished by 5:30 you’ll be aware of the constraints on
        your time and motivated to use it wisely.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="secnum">2.</div>
      <h2>Serialize,<br />serialize,<br />serialize</h2>
      <p>
        Focus on one big project at a time, and see it to completion before
        moving onto the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s alluring to try to alleviate the anxiety of having too many
        responsibilities or ambitions by getting started on them all at once,
        but you’ll make little progress that way. Instead, train yourself to get
        incrementally better at tolerating that anxiety by consciously
        postponing everything you possibly can except for one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon the satisfaction of completing important projects will make that
        anxiety feel worthwhile, and as you complete them you’ll have less to be
        anxious about anyway.
      </p>

    <section>
      <div class="secnum">3.</div>
      <h2>Strategic underachievement</h2>
      <p>
        Simply because your time is finite, you’ll inevitably underachieve at
        something. When you can’t do it all, you can feel ashamed and give up.
        When you decide in advance what to fail at, you remove the sting of
        shame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nominate in advance whole areas of life in which you won’t expect
        excellence from yourself. Instead focus that time more effectively, and
        you won’t be surprised when you fail at what you planned to fail at all
        along.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="secnum">4.</div>
      <h2>Celebrate wins</h2>
      <p>
        The to-do list will never be finished. Inbox zero will inevitably
        refill. There’s an unhelpful assumption that you begin each morning with
        a productivity debt that you must pay off with hard work to achieve a
        zero-balance by evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep a “done” list which starts empty and fills up over the day. You
        could have spent the day doing nothing remotely constructive, and look
        what you did instead. Lower the bar for what gets to count as an
        accomplishment; small wins accrue.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="secnum">5.</div>
      <h2>Consolidate care</h2>
      <p>
        The attention economy demands urgency, bringing a litany of demands for
        your care every day. Consciously choose your battles in industry,
        charity, activism, and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make a real difference, you must focus your finite capacity for care.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="secnum">6.</div>
      <h2>Embrace boring & single-purpose technology</h2>
      <p>
        Modern digital devices offer distraction to a place where painful human
        limitations do not apply; you need never feel bored or constrained in
        your freedom of action—which isn’t the case when it comes to work that
        matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combat this by making your devices boring. Remove apps that distract
        (even consider Slack or Email). Switch your screen to grayscale. Use
        time-limiting reminders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose single-purpose devices like an e-reader where it’s tedious and
        awkward to do anything but read. If distracting apps are only a swipe
        away they’ll prove impossible to resist when the first twinge of boredom
        or difficulty of focus arises.
      </p>

      <div class="secnum">7.</div>
      <h2>Seek novelty in the&nbsp;mundane</h2>
      <p>
        The fewer weeks we have left the faster we seem to lose them. The
        likeliest explanation for this phenomenon is that our brains encode the
        passing of time on the basis of how much information we process in any
        given interval.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cramming your life with novel experiences does work, but can also lead
        to existential overwhelm and is also impractical, especially if you have
        a job or children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively pay more attention to every moment no matter how mundane.
        Plunge into the life you already have with twice the intensity and your
        life will feel twice as full and will be remembered as lasting twice as
        long. Meditation, going on unplanned walks, photography, journaling,
        anything that draws your attention more fully to the present.
      </p>

    <section>
      <div class="secnum">8.</div>
      <h2>Be a researcher in relationships</h2>
      <p>
        When presented with a challenging or boring moment with another person,
        deliberately adopt an attitude of curiosity in which your goal isn’t to
        achieve any particular outcome or explain your position but to figure
        out who this human being is who we’re with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This curiosity is well suited to the unpredictability of life with
        others because it can be satisfied by their behaving in ways you like or
        dislike whereas the stance of demanding a certain result is frustrated
        each time things fail to go your way.
      </p>

      <h2>Cultivate instantaneous generosity</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever a generous impulse arises your mind: to give money, to check in
        on a friend, send an email praising someone’s work, act on that impulse
        right away. If you put it off for whatever reason, you’ll likely not get
        back to it. The only acts of generosity that count are the ones you’re
        actually making.
      </p>
      <p>
        People are social creatures, and generous action reliably makes us feel
        much happier.

      <h2>Practice doing <mark>nothing</mark></h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to the challenge of using your four thousand weeks well,
        the capacity to do nothing is indispensable. If you can’t bear the
        discomfort of not acting you’re far more likely to make poor choices
        with your time simply to feel as if you’re acting. Calm down, gain
        autonomy over your choices, and make better ones.
      </p>
      <h3>Do nothing meditation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Set a timer, even for only five minutes.</li>
        <li>Sit in a chair and then stop trying to do anything.</li>
        <li>
          Every time you notice you’re doing something, including thinking or
          focusing on your breathing, stop doing it.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you notice you’re criticizing yourself inwardly for doing things
          well&hellip; that’s a thought too so stop doing that.
        </li>
        <li>Keep on stopping until the timer goes off.</li>
      </ol>
