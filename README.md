# Four thousand weeks

A tribute to [the book](https://amzn.to/3GnJlR9) by Oliver Burkeman, an
exploration of time management in the face of human finitude, and addressing the
anxiety of “getting everything done.”

Built by @leebyron in the New Years season of 2023 🍾 in the spirit of accepting
time's endless march forward 🕰.
